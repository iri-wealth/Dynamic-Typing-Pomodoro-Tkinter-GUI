The Dynamic Typing Pomodoro is a dynamic timer that a User
can set up for his/her work. Currently the timer is set up only for
three minutes. However, a User can set up the Timer for
any special time: 30 minutes or even 1 hour.
The Timer Project uses Tkinter as UI, the datetime formatting
and the json module. The Timer is useful for the User
time management.
